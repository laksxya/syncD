At the Grameen Foundation for Social Impact (GFSI),\nwe see technology and financial inclusion as major tools to overcome\npoverty.\nGrameen Foundation for Social Impact (GFSI) has launched the \"Scaling Agent\nViability and Quality in India\" project, a bold initiative to enhance\nfinancial inclusion in underserved areas significantly. Over three years,\nthe project will focus on bolstering agent viability, diversifying product\nofferings, and expanding the Business Correspondent (BC) network by\nactively recruiting more women agents. The project will leverage\ncutting-edge technology and geospatial data to pinpoint geographic,\ndemographic, and infrastructural gaps in underserved areas, utilizing a\nvisual platform for interactive data analysis. This innovative data-driven\ndecision tool, accessible to all BC industry stakeholders, fosters\ntransparency and aids strategic planning for financial inclusion in\nunderbanked regions.\nA pivotal aspect of this initiative is the collaboration between GFSI &\nProtean to develop a GIS-based data visualization platform. To amplify\nawareness,* a national-level hackathon called the \"TerraTech challenge\" is\nset to take centre stage in the first quarter of 2024.* Comprising zonal\nand national-level rounds, the hackathon will be conducted in collaboration\nwith various academic partners across the country\u2013 with IIIT Bengaluru as\nthe academic partner for the South Zone. This dynamic event is poised to\nbring together minds from diverse backgrounds, fuelling creativity and\ninnovation to address the challenges of financial inclusion. Through this\nhackathon, GFSI aims to push the boundaries of technological solutions and\ncreate a lasting impact on India's financial services landscape.\nThe participants will work in teams, comprising of up to 3 members onsite,\nwhile the rest join virtually. The travel and boarding will be borne by\nparticipants. The proposed solution must be open source, and each team must\nsubmit a three-page concept note containing:\n   1. Understanding about the platform and solution\n   2. The technical architecture (API Integration will be preferred)\n   3. Implementation Plan\n   4. Maintenance Plan\n   5. Budget\nAfter evaluation at a zonal level, the top teams from each zone will\ncompete at a national level, where the winners get to implement their\nsolution along with the help of the Grameen Foundation after signing a\ncontract of 2 years.\nTo register for the Terratech Hackathon, use the following link\nhttp://terratech.gfsi.in*.*\nThe registration opens for South on 16th January and closes on 23th January\n2024.\nThe South Zonal Round will be held on 15th & 16th February 2024 at IIIT\nBengaluru.

Government departments\n   and various organizations will present real-world problem statements,\n   offering participants the opportunity to tackle issues directly relevant to\n   today's cybersecurity landscape.\n   Through engaging in these challenges, students will not only sharpen\n   their technical skills but also gain a firsthand understanding of the\n   pressing issues faced by government agencies and organizations in the realm\n   of cyber threats. By providing a platform for collaboration and innovation,\n   our aim is to nurture the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.\n   This hackathon seeks to instill in students a sense of responsibility\n   and awareness regarding cyber threats while equipping them with the skills\n   necessary to contribute to the ongoing efforts in securing our digital\n   future.\n   2.\n*Who is conducting this? *News1st Channel is organizing an event scheduled\n   for February 28th and 29th featuring three distinct tracks:\n      - Hackathon for Students\n      - Startup Pavilion\n      - Main Event\n      3. *Hackathon Flow*\n      1. *Day 1, Feb 5th:* Introduction to Topics/Problem Statement\n      2. *Day 1*: Team Listing & Registration\n      3. *Day 10, Feb 15th: *Feedback Session & Mentoring (Online)\n      4. *Day 15, Feb 20th:* Individual Colleague Pitch\n      5. *Event Day - 1*: Pitch Session\n      6. *Event Day - 2:* Awards Presentation\n   4. *Timeline - **Hackathon Preliminary Rounds: February 5, 2024, to\n   February 21, 2024. **Main Event: February 28 - 29, 2024*\n   5. *Hackathon Prize money -  *Winner: INR 2 Lakh, 1st Runner-up: INR 1\n   lakh, 2nd Runner-up: INR 50K\n*Problem Statements: *\n*1. Problem #1 -  Phishing and Social Engineering*\nDesign a real-time AI system that detects and flags suspicious emails, SMS,\nand social media messages attempting to phish or socially engineer\nfinancial information from customers. The solution may be in the form of a\ndesktop/mobile application or a web browser plugin.\nBonus: Integrate the system with existing communication channels to\nseamlessly warn users about potential scams without disrupting legitimate\ninteractions.\nConsiderations -\n- Design clear and intuitive interface for warnings and explanations.\n- Allow users to adjust sensitivity levels and tailor detection rules.\n- Avoid excessive notifications that disrupt user workflow.\n- Regularly update AI models and threat intelligence to maintain\neffectiveness against evolving phishing tactics.\n*2. Problem #2 - * * Data Privacy and Security*\nDevelop innovative solutions to anonymize and secure sensitive financial\ndata while still enabling valuable analytics and insights for risk\nmanagement and personalized services.\nBonus: Explore decentralized data storage or blockchain-based approaches to\nenhance data ownership and control for customers.\n*3.  Problem #3 -  **Vulnerability and Security Configuration Management\nfor Big IT Infrastructure (B2B Enterprises) *\nEnterprises with extensive IT infrastructure find it challenging to\nprioritize vulnerabilities and manage security configurations. Develop a\nsolution that assists them in identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities\nfor patching, as well as managing security misconfigurations.\n*4.  Problem # 4 -* *Unified Management of Highly Distributed IT\nInfrastructure (B2B)*\nLarge enterprises often have highly distributed IT infrastructure across\nvarious locations, multiple cloud providers, and on-premises setups.\nCreating a solution that enables enterprises to manage and secure their\ndistributed IT infrastructure seamlessly from a single console is crucial.\nThis solution should provide centralized control over all servers and\ncomponents.\n*5. Problem #5 - Security of Manufacturing Units in Critical Infrastructure\n(B2G & B2B)*\nWith the integration of automation and the internet in Industry 4.0,\nsecuring critical infrastructure like power grids, manufacturing units,\nwater supply systems, healthcare infrastructure, and railways becomes\nparamount. Focus on the security of manufacturing units, particularly those\nutilizing Industrial IoTs, ICS/SCADA/OT devices, and robots. Develop a\nsolution that controls network communication, filters malicious commands,\nand ensures security without disrupting operations.\n*6. Problem #6 -  **Cloud Security for Businesses (B2B)*\nAs businesses transition rapidly to cloud technologies, there is a\nmisconception about cloud platforms being inherently secure. The reality is\nthat the responsibility for a significant portion of cloud security lies\nwith the users. Create a solution to identify misconfigurations, publicly\nopen services, and APIs in cloud platforms, providing assistance in\nsecuring the cloud environment.\n*7. Problem #7 - Phishing Attack Security*\nPhishing attacks, initiating 94% of cyber incidents, often start with\nmalicious emails. Develop a solution that allows organizations or\nindividuals to proactively check emails for malicious attachments, sender\nreputations, and potentially harmful content. This tool aims to prevent the\ncompromise of networks through phishing attacks, including those initiated\nthrough advanced language models like ChatGPT.\n*8. Problem #8 -  Advanced Cybersecurity Testing*\nTraditional Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) may\nfall short in providing comprehensive security coverage. Create an\nautomated solution that goes beyond traditional VAPT by incorporating\nvarious attack tactics, techniques, and procedures. This tool should assess\nnetwork architecture, simulate ransomware attacks, and provide\norganizations with a detailed understanding of their internal and external\nattack surfaces.\n*Basic Rules of the Hackathon: *\nRule 1: Minimum 3 students in a team and Maximum 5.\nRule 2: No student should be a part of two teams\nRule 3: Teams must be formed within your own college\nRule 4: Prototype + Presentation needs to be showcased to the jury\nRule 5: Few teams from PESU will be shortlisted for the finals at IIsc.\nFinal rounds will be in IISC campus on 28th and 29th Feb, 2024.\nRule 6: Utilizing resources from the internet or any other source is\npermitted.
